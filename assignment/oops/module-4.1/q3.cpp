Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) are two different programming 
paradigms:

- OOPS:
  - Focuses on objects that combine data and methods.
  - Emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Aims for modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

- POP:
  - Focuses on procedures or functions that operate on data.
  - Organizes code into routines or functions.
  - Aims for a linear and procedural flow of control.

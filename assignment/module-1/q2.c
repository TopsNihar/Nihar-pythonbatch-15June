/2]Explain types of software?
//->1.system operater
  	I]Operating System: It is the main program of a computer system. When the computer system ON it is the first software that loads
	 into the computerâ€™s memory. Basically, it manages all the resources such as computer memory, CPU, printer, hard disk, etc., and 
	 provides an interface to the user, which helps the user to interact with the computer system. It also provides various services 
	 to other computer software. Examples of operating systems are Linux, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, etc.
    II]Language Processor: As we know that system software converts the human-readable language into a machine language and vice versa. 
	 So, the conversion is done by the language processor. It converts programs written in high-level programming languages like Java, C,
	 C++, Python, etc(known as source code), into sets of instructions that are easily readable by machines(known as object code or
	 machine code).
    III]Device Driver: A device driver is a program or software that controls a device and helps that device to perform its functions.
	 Every device like a printer, mouse, modem, etc. needs a driver to connect with the computer system eternally. So, when you connect
	 a new device with your computer system, first you need to install the driver of that device so that your operating system knows
	 how to control or manage that device.
  //2.application software
  	I]General Purpose Software: This type of application software is used for a variety of tasks and it is not limited to performing a 
	 specific task only. For example, MS-Word, MS-Excel, PowerPoint, etc.
    II]Customized Software: This type of application software is used or designed to perform specific tasks or functions or designed 
	 for specific organizations. For example, railway reservation system, airline reservation system, invoice management system, etc.
    III]Utility Software: This type of application software is used to support the computer infrastructure. It is designed to analyze,
	 configure, optimize and maintains the system, and take care of its requirements as well. For example, antivirus, disk fragmenter, 
	 memory tester, disk repair, disk cleaners, registry cleaners, disk space analyzer, etc.

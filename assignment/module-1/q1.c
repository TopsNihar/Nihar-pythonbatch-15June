->  software is a collection of programming.
    Ex: ios,windows

->  software engineering isis technique through which we can devlop or create software.
1. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, 
 and maintenance.
2. It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development 
 process.
3. By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers can 
 create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of its users.
4. Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.
5. The main goal of Software Engineering is to develop software applications for improving quality,  budget, and time efficiency.
6. Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time, and
  within the required requirements.

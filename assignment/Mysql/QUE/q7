**What is DML Compiler in SQL?**
   - The DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler is a part of a DBMS that processes DML commands. DML commands are used for managing data within
    schema objects. These commands include operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. Examples of DML commands are
     `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

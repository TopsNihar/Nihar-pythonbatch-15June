 **What is the MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?**
   - It seems like there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the term "MF Cod Rule." If you are referring to "BCNF" (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) 
   or another normalization rule, please clarify. BCNF is an advanced form of the third normal form (3NF) and deals with certain types of 
   anomalies that 3NF does not address.

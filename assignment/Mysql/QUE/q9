**What is Savepoint? How to Create a Savepoint? Write a Query:**
   - A savepoint is a marker within a transaction that allows you to roll back to that point without affecting the entire transaction. It is
    useful for managing complex transactions where you might want to undo part of the work if an error occurs.

   **Example Query:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;

   SAVEPOINT savepoint1;

   -- Some SQL operations

   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint1; -- Rollback to the savepoint

   COMMIT;

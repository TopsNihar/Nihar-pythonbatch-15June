 **What do you understand by Data Redundancy?**
   - Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database. It can lead to inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and 
   increased storage costs. Proper database design and normalization techniques aim to minimize data redundancy by ensuring that each piece of 
   information is stored only once and properly linked to other related data.

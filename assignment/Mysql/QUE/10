**What is a Trigger and How to Create a Trigger in SQL?**
    - A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed or fired when certain events occur in a table, such as 
    insertions, updates, or deletions. Triggers are used for tasks such as enforcing business rules, validating input data, and maintaining audit
     logs.

    **Example of Creating a Trigger:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
    AFTER INSERT ON Employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, EmployeeID, ActionTime)
        VALUES ('INSERT', NEW.EmployeeID, NOW());
    END;

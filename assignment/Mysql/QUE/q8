 **What is SQL Key Constraints? Writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints:**
   - SQL key constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to ensure data integrity. Common key constraints include:
     - **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
     - **Foreign Key:** Ensures referential integrity by linking columns in one table to the primary key of another table.
     - **Unique Key:** Ensures all values in a column are unique.
     - **Not Null:** Ensures a column cannot have null values.

     **Example:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       LastName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       FirstName VARCHAR(255),
       DepartmentID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
   );

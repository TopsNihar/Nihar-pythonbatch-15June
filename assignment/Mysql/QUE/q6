**What is DDL Interpreter?**
   - The DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter is a component of a DBMS that processes DDL commands. DDL commands are used to define and
    modify database schema objects such as tables, indexes, and views. Examples of DDL commands include `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and 
    `DROP TABLE`.

**What is Normalization?**
   - Normalization is a process in database design used to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves organizing a database 
   into tables and defining relationships between them in such a way that each piece of data is stored only once. The process is done through a
    series of steps known as normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), each addressing different types of redundancy and dependencies.

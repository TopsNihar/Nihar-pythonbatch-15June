 **What is the Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**
   - **DBMS (Database Management System):** A DBMS is software that facilitates the creation, manipulation, and management of databases. It allows
    users to store, retrieve, and manage data in a structured way.
   - **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):** An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in a tabular format and uses relationships 
   (foreign keys) between tables to maintain data integrity. RDBMSs adhere to the principles of the relational model, and they support SQL 
   (Structured Query Language). Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
